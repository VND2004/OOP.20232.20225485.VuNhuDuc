Java is a pass-by-value programming language.

2. After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?
Because Java is a pass-by-value programming language, so the function swap() swaps the targets of the two references, not the real objects.

3. After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?
Because it is still pointed to the same object but the attribute(title) of its object has been changed so the title of the JungleDVD change.
